### Building

You can compile the JustMock Lite project with **Visual Studio 2015 Community for Desktop and greater**. 

1. In Visual Studio, open the **Telerik.JustMockLite.sln** file.
2. Dismiss any *Unsupported project type* warnings. You can still build JustMock Lite.<br/>*Visual Studio Community* shows this warning to indicate that it does not support the Silverlight projects included in the JustMock Lite solution.
3. Build the project in a **DebugFree** or **ReleaseFree** configuration.<br/>This will ensure that the JustMock Lite unit tests remain green.
4. Locate the JustMock Lite binaries in the **..\\..\\Binaries** folder.
